## Description

The app helps users plan the most efficient order for visiting all desired destinations using the modified [TSP](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) algorithm. Optional constraints, such as a location must be visited before another location can be added. The shortest path between pairs is computed using the Google Maps API.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app
Will be available soon.
